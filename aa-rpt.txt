This PHP directory converts a xml file,
created with xtuple Openrp
into a PHP file that once executed 
will create a PDF or a XLS
mi_report.xml -> mi_report.php
you get mi_report.php typing into terminal:
# php aPDF.php mi_report.xml >> mi_report.php
and in the case of xls typing into terminal:
# php aXLS.php mi_report.xml >> mi_report.php

The developer has to install by his own 
the open source libraries Fpdf and PHPExcel
if he is going to see the result of the PHP
generated.

The developer has also to configure the connection
to the database which is expected to be a PDO
conexion loaded into the variable $db.

The developer has to check the things said above in
the template files (pPA.php or pXA.php) where the 
location of the connection and library directories
can be changed although they are not needed during
the convertion.

Since the conversion is not exact, the developer
will have to trim some lines of the generated PHP
and in the complex cases only consider it as a push
in the location of elements,
so it is recommended to read the manuals of
PHPEXcel, Fpdf, PDO.  On the same issue
it will make your program faster to erase
the unnecessary changes in font, mainly in the Detail
section, for instance erase there instructions like:
 XLS: $xls->getActiveSheet()->getStyle('M'.($iY + 1))->applyFromArray($lsCC);
 PDF: $this->SetFont('Courier','',11); o $this->SetFontSize(11);

To make a nice use of parameters this program creates
a pure HTML form to enter new values on the run,
the bool parameters will be taken as activating filters;
it also converts, at least partially, openRPT MetaSql,
that allows to change the query of data on the run
by changing the filter of the query.

It recognizes heads and feet for pdf but not for page
for now.

Internally the program reads the templates
(pPA or pXA), line by line extracting from
them the labels that will be found later in the xml,
those labels are extracted along with the
PHP instructions or functions that such labels
must be converted to when reading the xml. These
templates can be expanded to include for instance to draw
rectangles in the Detail section.
